Overview
My work in the project is on cleaning and preprocessing of text data.
The cleaning process ensures the text is standardized and ready for further analysis by removing unnecessary elements and normalizing the content.

Cleaning Process
The cleaning process we used:
Removing unnecessary elements such as:
URLs (ex. http://abc.com, www.abc.com).
Hashtags (ex. #xyz) and mentions (ex @user123).
Non-alphabetical characters (ex. numbers, punctuation, special characters).
Converting text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
The cleaned text is stored in a new column named cleaned_text for analysis.

Features
Remove URLs- Eliminates all links from the text to simplify content.
Remove Hashtags and Mentions- Strips out social media-specific elements such as #hashtags and @mentions.
Remove Non-Alphabetic Characters- Removes numbers, punctuation, and special symbols while keeping only alphabetic characters and spaces.
Convert to Lowercase- Ensures all text is in lowercase for consistency.
