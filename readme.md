My work in this project is cleaning and preprocessing text data . 
The cleaning process ensures the text is standardized and ready for further analysis by removing unnecessary elements and normalizing the content.

Cleaning Process
The cleaning process involves the following steps:

Removing unnecessary elements such as:
URLs (ex. http://abc.com, www.abc.com).
Hashtags (ex #xyz) and mentions (ex. @abc123).
Non-alphabetical characters (ex. numbers, punctuation, special characters).
Converting text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
The cleaned text is stored in a new column named cleaned_text for analysis.

Features
Remove URLs- Eliminates all links from the text to simplify content.
Remove Hashtags and Mentions- Strips out social media-specific elements such as #hashtags and @mentions.
Remove Non-Alphabetic Characters- Removes numbers, punctuation, and special symbols while keeping only alphabetic characters and spaces.
Convert to Lowercase- Ensures all text is in lowercase for consistency.
