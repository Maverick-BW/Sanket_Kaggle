# Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation :(Abhijeet Pisal)

This repository demonstrates techniques for training and evaluating machine learning models using Word2Vec feature extraction, logistic regression, and random forest classifiers. Key functionalities include:

# Document Vectorization: 
                    Implements Word2Vec to generate document-level feature vectors.

# Logistic Regression: 
                    Trains and evaluates a logistic regression model with accuracy and classification report metrics.

# Random Forest Classifier: 
                    Trains and evaluates a random forest classifier for comparison.

# Feature Matrix: 
                    Applies feature extraction on tokenized texts and constructs a feature matrix for testing.

# Generating and Exporting Predictions:
                    This section of the pipeline focuses on creating predictions and saving them for further use or submission:

# Prediction DataFrame:
                    Generates a DataFrame containing the model's prediction
# Submission File:
                    Combines predictions with associated IDs from the test dataset  to create a submission-ready DataFrame 
# Google Colab Integration:
                    Includes functionality to interactively visualize the submission DataFrame using create prediction csv file in which predcitoins are stored
